### Overview

My friend was asked this question during a technical interview, so as practice I wrote my own solution with a test suite to pass in inputs to prove it works.

### Question

Write a method that determines if a string of parantheses have only parantheses with matched pairs.

### My Implementation

My solution that determines if a string of parantheses contains matching closing parantheses. For example given the string "(())" the function would return true, while given "())" it would return false.  My current implementation is an iterative solution however I am sure a recursive solution is also possible.
