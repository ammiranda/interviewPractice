My solution that determines if a string of parantheses contains matching parantheses.

This was a question asked to a friend of mine that interviewed at a major tech company.

For example given the string "(())" the function would return true, while given "())" it would return false.

My current implementation is an iterative solution however I am sure a recursive solution is also possible.
